According to the WHO, "Rates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and children. From 1975 to 2016, the prevalence of overweight or obese children and adolescents aged 5â€“19 years increased more than four-fold from 4% to 18% globally" (WHO, 2020). The prevalence of obesity is the result of certain factors which include lifestyle, diet, physical activties and broader environment (Mayo Clinic, 2023). Changes in work, transportation, and leisure activities have led to more sedentary lifestyles. Desk jobs, reliance on cars, and increased screen time contribute to a lack of physical activity. Some individuals may have a genetic predisposition to obesity, making it more challenging for them to maintain a healthy weight. A model that predicts whether a person may be at risk for obesity for new datasets would help those affected seek preventative treatment.

We are going to explore a dataset about certain factors that contribute to obesity. The goal of exploring this dataset is to create a predictive model that will predict family history with obesity for new datasets using:

* Weight
* Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC)
* Physical activity frequency (FAF)
* Number of main meals (NCP), and
* Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC)

Scientist, nutritionist, doctors and individuals will find this model very useful because it will help them pinpoint common causes of obesity and come up with more effective treatments and preventataive measures. These groups would prefer a classifier that is equally good at classifying positives and negatives because poor performance for either could cause undetected health conditions or medical overtreatment. We would also like our chosen model to provide reliable interpretative insights about the nature of the relationship between the variables in the dataset.
